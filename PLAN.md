# Implementation Plan

* For all tasks keep the README.md, docs.md and PLAN.md updated accordingly

## Phase 4: Visual Enhancements (Recommended Next)
*Complexity: Medium | Impact: High*

- [ ] **Asteroid belt** between Mars and Jupiter
  - Procedural asteroid generation using instanced meshes
  - Random sizes, rotations, orbital speeds
  - ~1000-5000 small rocks for performance
- [ ] **Comet trails**
  - Particle system for tail effect
  - Elliptical orbits crossing inner solar system
  - Glow shader for coma

## Phase 5: Extended Solar System
*Complexity: Medium | Impact: Medium*

- [ ] **Kuiper belt objects** (Pluto, Eris, Makemake, Haumea)
  - Add dwarf planets with orbital data
  - Extend camera max distance
  - Add to planet navigation
- [ ] **Spacecraft/satellite models**
  - ISS orbiting Earth
  - Voyager probes at outer edges
  - Simple 3D models or sprites

## Phase 6: Surface Improvements
*Complexity: High | Impact: Medium*

- [ ] **Day/night cycle** on planet surfaces
  - Sun position affects lighting
  - Dynamic shadows
  - City lights on night side (Earth)
- [ ] **Improved terrain generation**
  - Biome-specific features
  - Water reflections
  - Atmospheric scattering

## Phase 7: Audio Experience
*Complexity: Low | Impact: Medium*

- [ ] **Sound effects**
  - UI feedback sounds
  - Ambient space sounds
  - Planet-specific atmospheres
- [ ] **Background music**
  - Ambient space soundtrack
  - Volume controls
  - Mute option

### Priority Recommendation

1. **Phase 4** - Best visual impact for effort
2. **Phase 7** - Quick win, improves immersion
3. **Phase 5** - Expands content
4. **Phase 6** - Deepens surface exploration
